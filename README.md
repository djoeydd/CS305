# CS305

Artemis Financial, the client, sought to modernize its operations and enhance its software security. They required a file verification step to ensure secure communication in their web application. I successfully identified vulnerabilities in their code and recommended improvements to enhance security. This involved selecting an appropriate encryption algorithm, implementing secure communication over HTTPS, and adding checksum verification.

My ability to identify vulnerabilities and recommend effective solutions was a strong point. Secure coding is crucial because it safeguards sensitive data, prevents breaches, and maintains user trust. Software security enhances a company's overall wellbeing by protecting its reputation, avoiding legal issues, and ensuring business continuity.

The vulnerability assessment process was valuable but challenging due to the complexity of identifying potential risks. To increase security layers, I deployed encryption, switched to HTTPS, and added checksum verification. In the future, I would use tools like static code analysis and penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities and select appropriate mitigation techniques.

I ensured functionality and security through thorough testing after refactoring. I validated checksum verification, secure communication, and error-free execution. I utilized tools like the OWASP Dependency-Check to detect vulnerabilities in added code.

I used Java Keytool for certificate generation, encryption libraries for secure communication, and OWASP Dependency-Check for static testing. These practices will be valuable for future tasks requiring secure coding and vulnerability assessment.

In future assignments, I could showcase my ability to identify and address vulnerabilities, implement secure communication, and perform static testing to ensure code security. This demonstrates my skills in enhancing software security and contributing to a company's robust software infrastructure.
